## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [Gloodata](https://gloodata.com/download/)
- MySQL server with Northwind sample database

Check that you are in a recent version of `uv`:

```bash
uv self update
```

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/gloodata/extension-northwind.git
     cd extension-northwind
     ```

2. **Start Northwind MySQL docker database**
    ```
    docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d -p 3307:3306 --name northwind -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret manchestercodes/northwind
    ```

3. **Optional - Update database dates**
    The script updates historical dates in the database so that the intervals between dates are preserved, but shifted to align with the current date. This ensures that the relative distribution and spacing of the original dates remain consistent in the updated data.
    ```
    docker exec -i northwind mysql -uroot -psupersecret northwind < update_dates.sql
    ```

4. **Optional - Configure MySQL connection**:  
     Set the following environment variables as needed. Not needed if you run the Northwind database as indicated in step #2:
     - `MYSQL_HOST` (default: `localhost`)
     - `MYSQL_PORT` (default: `3307`)
     - `MYSQL_USER` (default: `root`)
     - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
     - `MYSQL_DATABASE` (default: `northwind`)

5. **Run the extension**:
